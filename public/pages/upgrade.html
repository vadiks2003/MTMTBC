    <!-- The upgrades aren't made yet
    ideas:
        after sending X amount of letters, you get coins. you can spend these coins on upgrades.
        upgrade ideas:
            1. HEX typing: allow user to type in HEX instead of binary. Thanks to binary being annoying to type compared to hex, i suppose i should rather allow it after few binary types
            2. IMAGE TYPING: i don't know if i can do it, but basically i want a user to be able to upload images, through typing in each HEX value of pixel
            3. buy image plot
        ideas on obtaining coins:
        1 coin per 5 letters sent.
        2 coins per each pixel in an image
            (
             4by4 pixels = 32 coins per image;
             8by8 pixels = 128 coins per image;
             16x16 pixels = 512 coins per image
             24x24 pixels = 1 152 coins per image
            )
		ideas on prices:
        10 coins => hex typing
        40 coins => image typing (4 by 4 pixels)
        1.4^A coins => add +1 width and length pixels. "a" is amount of this item bought.
            meaning if i have 0 a = it costs 1 coin. 
            if i have 1 a = it costs 1.4 coins       1.4 coins spent overall
            if i have 2 a = it costs 1.96 coins      3.36 coins spent overall
            if i have 3 a = it costs 2.74 coins      6.1 coins spent overall
            if i have 4 a = it costs 3.84 coins      9.94 coins spent overall
            if i have 5 a = it costs 5.37 coins      15.31 coins spent overall
            if i have 10 a = it costs 29 coins       97.73 coins spent overall
            if i have 15 a = it costs 155 coins      540.99 coins spent overall
            if i have 20 a = it costs 836.68 coins   2 924.89 coins spent overall
            16x16 would be 12 a's and thats 195 coins overall
            24x24 would be 20 a's and thats 2 924 coins overall
            1024x1024 would be 1020 a's and thats... a lot...  4 with 149 zeroes. good luck filling  million pixels with just HEX through
            etc
                what its gonna do is: i have 4by4 pixels. i buy one. now its 5 by 5 pixels. i buy two. now its 6 by 6 pixels. i buy 3. now its 7 by 7 pixels
                4+36 a's =40 by 40 pixels, thats 1600 pixels to fill in manually. fair enough right?
        allow people to upvote each others posts: these give uploader coins. around 1 coin per upvote multiplied by (1/(0.05*sqrt(subs))) where subs is subscribers amount. 
        if user has less than 100 subscribers, round it to 0.1. bigger amounts will decrease coins per upvote
            the sudden increase in coins at 100 subscribers up to 2 coins per upvote which goes down is intentional
        example: a user with 
            400 followers gets 1 coin per upvote
            1 600 followers gets 0.5 coin per upvote
            40 000 followers gets 0.1 coin per upvote 
            160 000 followers gets 0.05 coins per upvote
            and just for fun =) 100 000 000 followers gets 0.002 coins per upvote, that would make 1 coin per 500 upvotes

        allow people to subscribe to each other: it will slightly boost coins. let it be a modifier of (* sqrt(amountofsubs))
            lets say a guy with 10 000 subs uploads 10 by 10 img. instead of getting 200 coins, he gets 20 000 coins
            lets say a guy with 1 000 000 subs uploads an image 32 by 32. instead of getting 2048 coins, he gets 2 048 000 coins
                (reminder: to get 32 by 32 you need to spend 43 213 coins overall)
        1 upvote => +0.1 coin
        1 downvote => scale a big evil face on "my profile" section based on amount of downvotes divided by amount of posts. turn it into square root function size for max size
        


    thanks to coins being attached to a user, i will have to implement registration and login. i am POOR at security so i must add disclaimer to put random password and that nothing is protected.-->
