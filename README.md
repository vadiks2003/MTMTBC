# how to run

open index.html after downloading

# how does it work

in the below of the page, you can see all the codes.
try punching in "hello" with these codes in binary. then in HEX
it's not ASCII and not unicode, i didn't really think of doing that at the time

# plans

i actually wanted to add ability to add entire phrases with a single code, but something went wrong and it broke and i didn't want to do it again
also plans can be found in pages/upgrade.html

# guthub

i am very poor at github and  dont know what -u origin stands for in the command line. yes i use command line
i am too lazy to google it, and last time i did google it, i didn't find an answer

# QA:
**Q: why am i doing it**

A: i want to laern front end, and to learn it, i should have a motivation. the biggest motivational thing i could find - is making a random idea i had stuck in my head 

**Q: where is react or angular** 

A: this specific "project", was meant for me actually making my idea come true, by using jquery. later i found out that jquery isnt really that good and i actualyl forogt about it and added typical js right after jquery code. besides that, i just find it easier to write it on pure JS
p.s. i still don't know jquery

**Q: why is everything in main.js only? why don't you use like xml or json**

A: CORS policy is annoying. and i was too lazy to learn the http-server thing, it was also confusing for me. so i decided to make it all in one js file

**Q: you have a mistake at...**

A: if you found any mistakes i've done that i could've done, i would be very glad if you told me about one. any tips are welcome aswell. i might be too lazy to google, but i am not lazy to hear people tell me a 5 page worthy material in few words 

**Q: i am afraid of viruses/i am on the phone and want to see what this is about**

A: haha, i knew you're gonna ask it. nah, just kidding i didn't know if anybody would really have to. i actually recorded a video! and uploaded to discord. and i am not quite sure if i can embed a discord video to the readme.md, so next 2 things are screenshot and video both in media and cdn formats

oh and by the way i found out i can't really embed a video here. here's media discord video 

if you are not sure about viruses, just add it as embed in discord. embeds in discords cant be dangerous, max they can do is crash your discrod
